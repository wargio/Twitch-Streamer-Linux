        Value      Example                  Description                       
        ---------- ------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        OUTRES     "1280x720"               Twitch Output Resolution ("1920x1080" should be the maximum resolution)
        FPS        "24"                     Frame per Seconds (Suggested 24, 25, 30 or 60)
        THREADS    "4"                      Change this if you have a good CPU (Suggested 4 threads, Max 6 threads)
        QUALITY    "medium" or "veryfast"   Streaming Quality (ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo)
        WEBCAM     "/dev/video1"            WebCam chardevice under /dev
        WEBCAM_WH  "320:240"                WebCam Width end Height in the Output
        STREAM_KEY "live_xxxxxxxx_yyyyyy.." Your Twitch key (inside the script it takes the key from twitch_key file)
        SERVER     "live" or "live-fra"     Twitch Server list at http://bashtech.net/twitch/ingest.php
        CBR        "1000k" to "3000k"       Constant bitrate. Increase this to get a better pixel quality (Twitch suggest between 1000k to 3000k)

* Open the game that you want to stream and set window mode.
* Open a terminal, browse to the twitch script directory and run the script

        $ ./twitch.sh 

* If the avconv script gives you an error, use FFMPEG version. works exactly the same.

        $ ./twitch_ffmpeg.sh 

* Click with your Mouse on the game window
* Now you should be live (check on your channel).
* You can set the Audio settings (select the Null Output on pavucontrol)
* To stop the stream, click on the terminal and press CTRL+C
* **BE CAREFUL ON SHOWING THE TERMINAL SINCE AVCONV/FFMPEG PRINTS ON THE TERMINAL THE KEY**
* For suggestion or bugfix, please write to me on github. (I love suggestions! <3 )
* Please do NOT write for support on my BLOG. post bug reports on http://github.com/wargio/Twitch-Streamer-Linux !


Setup Audio (with pavucontrol):
-------------------------------
* My microphone is `Turtle BEach PLa Headset` and my game is `Syobon Action (Cat Mario)`
* Open the game you want to stream and exec the script
* Now open `pavucontrol`
* Under `Playback`:

* Under `Recording`:
![Screenshot from pavucontrol](https://raw.github.com/wargio/Twitch-Streamer-Linux/master/Screenshots/Twitch_Audio01.png)
* Done (For `ffmpeg/avconv` setting,  `Monitor of MicAudio` or `Monitor of GameAudio`. it's the same).
* If you don't see any `Monitor of MicAudio` or `Monitor of GameAudio`, but only `Monitor of null output`, use it, don't worry.
